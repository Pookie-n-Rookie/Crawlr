Biology is the study of life in all its forms. It encompasses a vast range of topics, from the molecular level to the ecosystem level. Physiology, on the other hand, is the study of how living organisms function. It focuses on the mechanisms that allow organisms to survive and reproduce. 

Here's a breakdown of the key differences between biology and physiology:

**Biology**

* **Scope:** Broad and encompasses all aspects of life
* **Focus:**  Structure, function, evolution, genetics, and diversity of living organisms
* **Examples:** Studying the anatomy of a plant, the behavior of animals, or the evolution of species.

**Physiology**

* **Scope:** Narrower, focusing on the function of living organisms
* **Focus:**  How organs, tissues, cells, and molecules work together to maintain life
* **Examples:** Studying how the heart pumps blood, how the lungs exchange gases, or how the brain controls movement.

**Relationship:**

Physiology is a sub-discipline of biology. It delves deeper into the "how" of biological processes, building upon the foundational knowledge provided by biology.


## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoology

**Zoology** is the branch of biology that deals with the animal kingdom.  Zoologists study the behavior, physiology, classification, origin, and distribution of animals. 

**History:**

Zoology has ancient roots, with early civilizations observing and classifying animals for practical purposes, such as hunting and agriculture. 

**Sub-disciplines:**

Zoology encompasses a wide range of sub-disciplines, including:

* **Mammalogy:** The study of mammals
* **Ornithology:** The study of birds
* **Herpetology:** The study of reptiles and amphibians
* **Entomology:** The study of insects
* **Ichthyology:** The study of fish
* **Malacology:** The study of mollusks

**Methods:**

Zoologists employ a variety of methods to study animals, including:

* **Observation:** Observing animals in their natural habitats
* **Experimentation:** Conducting experiments to test hypotheses about animal behavior or physiology
* **Molecular biology:** Analyzing the DNA and proteins of animals
* **Comparative anatomy:** Comparing the anatomy of different animal species

**Importance:**

Zoology is important for understanding the diversity and complexity of life on Earth. It also has practical applications in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and conservation.

**Intro to Animal Physiology or Zoology?**

I'm a freshman at Virginia Tech and trying to decide between taking Intro to Animal Physiology or Intro to Zoology. I'm interested in pre-med and eventually becoming a physician. 

**Any advice?**

**Comments:**

* **u/VT_PreMed:**  If you're pre-med, Intro to Animal Physiology will be more directly relevant to your studies. It covers the systems of the body and how they work, which is essential for understanding human physiology. Zoology is a broader subject and may not be as focused on the human body.

* **u/VT_BiologyMajor:** Both classes are great! Zoology is a fantastic introduction to the animal kingdom, while Physiology dives deep into how animals function. Ultimately, it depends on your specific interests. If you want a broader overview of animals, Zoology is a good choice. If you're more interested in the mechanics of how animals work, Physiology is the way to go.

* **u/VT_Professor:**  As a professor in the department, I can tell you both classes are excellent. If you're unsure, consider taking an introductory biology course first to get a better understanding of the fundamentals.
