Provide steps to integrate Tailwind CSS version 4 with a React App. Use code examples where possible.
```

## Response
```
To integrate Tailwind CSS version 4 with a React App, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies

Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
### Step 2: Initialize Tailwind CSS

Initialize Tailwind CSS by running the following command:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
This will create a `tailwind.config.js` file in your project root.

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Configure Tailwind CSS by updating the `tailwind.config.js` file to include your custom configurations. Here is an example configuration:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    mode: 'jit',
    purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
    theme: {
        extend: {},
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: [],
};
```
### Step 4: Update your `index.css` file

Update your `index.css` file to include the Tailwind CSS import:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
### Step 5: Use Tailwind CSS in your React components

Use Tailwind CSS in your React components by adding the `className` prop to your JSX elements. Here is an example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <div className="max-w-md mx-auto p-4 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md">
            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">My Component</h1>
            <p className="text-lg">This is my component.</p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Tailwind CSS version 4 with your React App.

Alternatively, you can also create a new React app with Tailwind CSS using the `create-react-app` command with the `--template` flag:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-tailwindcss
```
This will create a new React app with Tailwind CSS already installed and configured.
```

Compare the features of Samsung S24 and iPhone 16 focusing on specifications and usability.
```

## Response
```
The Samsung Galaxy S24 and iPhone 16 are two of the most highly anticipated smartphones of the year. Both devices promise to deliver top-notch performance, impressive cameras, and sleek designs. But which one is right for you?

The Samsung Galaxy S24 features a large 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, with a fast 120Hz refresh rate and a high-resolution Quad HD+ panel. The phone is powered by a large 5000mAh battery, with support for fast charging and wireless charging. The Galaxy S24 also features a quad-camera setup, with a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP front camera, and support for 8K video recording.

The iPhone 16, on the other hand, features a 6.7-inch Super Retina HD display, with a fast 120Hz refresh rate and a high-resolution Quad HD panel. The phone is powered by a large 4500mAh battery, with support for fast charging and wireless charging. The iPhone 16 also features a dual-camera setup, with a 48MP primary sensor, a 12MP front camera, and support for 4K video recording.

In terms of performance, both phones are powered by the latest and greatest processors from their respective manufacturers. The Galaxy S24 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, while the iPhone 16 is powered by the Apple A16 Bionic chip. Both processors deliver fast performance and efficient battery life.

One of the main differences between the two phones is the design. The Galaxy S24 features a more curved design, with a larger 6.8-inch display and a more premium feel. The iPhone 16, on the other hand, features a more angular design, with a smaller 6.7-inch display and a more minimalist aesthetic.

The camera is another area where the two phones differ. The Galaxy S24 features a quad-camera setup, with a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP front camera, and support for 8K video recording. The iPhone 16, on the other hand, features a dual-camera setup, with a 48MP primary sensor, a 12MP front camera, and support for 4K video recording.
